## Can't find its mom

# can implement sound

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.


the idea of being lost in mall, or a market with a singular particle in the middle of the screen and a circular crowd of people around it.
still not sure if i want to actualize the mom. just the feeling of being hopeless.

having a barrier between mom and child. 

2 key parts:
to make visual effect of the crowd
think of the interaction ( a.what happens when the kid meets another particle?? or b.what happens when it meets his mom if ever?? )

a. to make the space around the kid change shape (as if the crowd is moving away from the particle)

colors: maybe orange 
movement: chaotic crowd but the kid is slow
shape: circular
number of particles:
sounds: hollow sounds, (ghoresh) or like a constant noise to show the state of being helpless and have no control


Each student will create a particle system using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Everyone
will be assigned a "personality" for their system, which should be embodied using movement,
colors, and behaviors of your particle system. Consider:
• Color and shape
Speed, movements, or easing
Number of particles and how they interact with each other
Interactions or behaviours of the system with the user or environment
Other creative elements like sounds, changes over time, or other ways of expression.
Be creative, look up particle systems and see whats possible, but don't feel limited by what most
particle systems look like. How can you re-imagine this code framework to make many small
parts that work together (or against each other)?

If you can’t describe what you want to do, how is the computer supposed to know?


Here are a few things we can plan out before we even begin to code:
- What does the system look like?
- What kind of movements, colours, and shapes are involved?
- What does a particle being created look like? How long does it live? How does it get
destroyed?
- How long does a particle last? Forever? Until something happens to it?
- Are there multiple types of particles? Do they interact with each other or themselves?
- How do the particles interact with each other? How do they interact with the browser
or canvas borders?
- Do the particles interact with the viewer? If so, how?
- Are there time considerations? Do the individual particles change during their
lifespan? Does the lifespan of the entire particle system change over time?
Feel free to draw it out and find examples. Before you even begin to code, you should
have a good idea of your end result. Its okay if you don’t get there, but it will help you
know your next steps more clearly.


Consider how you can embody your theme within your particles,
consider:
- Be abstract rather than representational.
- Make a mood board of colours or shapes that reflect his feeling
- Is the interaction between the user, or the particles?



interactive. but you control only the direction of sight and cant see pass the crowd of people, so in a way there is no point. 




- Is it a game? Is it playful? How do the particles move?
- What reminds you of this situation?
- Could constructive a narrative help?
You can swap your theme once, only once!


in readme you can write about limitations, what I would hope to do better. the pros and cons.
